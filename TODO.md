- [ ] Improve score tally aesthetics
- [ ] Finish the level earlier -- if all unseen spots = num mines - num flags
- [ ] Sounds
- [ ] Advanced level selector
- [ ] Some crazy features for levels, like:
    - [ ] More warning patterns (e.g., hex)
    - [ ] Double-mines
    - [ ] Wrong numbers
    - [ ] Multiple layers (two or three 2D slices of a 3D level)
- [ ] Power-ups? (help with things like no-info areas)
    - [ ] Limited-use "rewind"
    - [ ] Kill a bomb (so you can see the number)
- [ ] Design roadmap for improvements and evolution of the game
- [ ] Moar g4m3s!
    - [ ] Picross-like
    - [ ] Controling robot in tunnels with guards?
- [ ] Change NumericInput to have those up and down stepper arrows and sane (expandable) min and max values

- [X] VERY BASIC Level progression (purchasing)
- [X] query option for clearing localStorage
- [X] Move random() out of the reducers to avoid determinism process. Can go to action!
- [X] Purchasing menu for features
- [X] Add selection menu for new games (Beginner / Advanced / Mobile / Custom)
- [X] Add flag and mine counter
- [X] Add mine graphic
- [X] Refactor handleClick so decisions/checks are done more upfront than back (i.e., "dumb reducer")
    - (read up on redux first)
- [X] Feature selector (for evo)
- [X] Profile system (w/ reset button) for store
- [X] Claimable currency from the score tally
- [X] BUG: Initializing preset mode should change config to be beginner if it was custom (or leave custom if that's available)
- [X] No bomb on first inspect (+ maybe it's a zero?)
- [X] right-click !
