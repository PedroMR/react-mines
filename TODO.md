# TODO

- [ ] Items you can buy that unlock and later increase your tool caps
- [ ] Info on "treasure" -- tiles away, how many found / not found
- [ ] Rewards when finding treasure (based on number of clicks so far)
- [ ] Bonus for conserving clicks (as item)
- [ ] Advanced level selector (e.g., for red mines, select easy / hard?)
- [ ] Power-ups? (help with things like no-info areas)
    - [/] Kill a bomb (so you can see the number)
    - [ ] Limited-use "rewind"  
- [ ] "layer" to look at treasure clues
- [ ] Highlight "speech" -- maybe modal story panels?
- [ ] Don't re-Typyst story lines you've seen already
- [ ] Loads of story and tutorial
    - Remember you can use the button below the grid to change into "flag placement" mode.
    - Or you can "right click" if you have a modern fancy mouse.
    - At shop without money to buy anything -- "hmm, guess it's time for you to earn more credits"
    - around 10th boom (not super early) -- "They knew it was a risky job. Don't worry, field agents get great funeral insurance."
    - At some point in the future, maybe after nearly passing a mission (or failing one!) -- "Hmm. Let's see if we can't get those numbers up, shall we? We don't want to see you demoted to field agent." (implying you'll die as a soldier)
- [ ] Improve debug menu (show which features available from what)
- [ ] Formalize feature when something happens in the game (flags) (e.g., clicking a bomb first unlocks the item that improves that)
- [ ] Bonus for level danger (mine ratio) 
- [ ] Maybe requirement for "only after next game"? (staggered item purchase)
- [ ] Reward tiers for performance (non-linear)?
- [ ] Improve score tally aesthetics
- [ ] Finish the level earlier -- if all unseen spots = num mines - num flags (as feature?)
- [ ] Add more sounds
    - BUY ITEM
    - SELECT and BACK for UI
    - auto-click
    - auto-zero out
    - place flag
- [ ] Some crazy features for levels, like:
    - [ ] More warning patterns (e.g., hex)
    - [ ] Double-mines
    - [ ] Wrong numbers
    - [ ] Multiple layers (two or three 2D slices of a 3D level)
    - [ ] Murphy Mode -- if you could be clicking a mine, you WILL click a mine
- [ ] Design roadmap for improvements and evolution of the game
- [ ] Moar g4m3s!
    - [ ] Picross-like
    - [ ] Controling robot in tunnels with guards?
- [ ] Change NumericInput to have those up and down stepper arrows and sane (expandable) min and max values
- [ ]? UI panels (for score and narrator)
